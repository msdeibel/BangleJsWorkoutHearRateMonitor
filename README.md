# Bangle.Js Workout Hear Rate Monitor
Workout heart rate monitor for the Bangle.js that buzzes when your heart rate hits the limits.

This app is for the [Bangle.js watch](https://banglejs.com/). While active it monitors your heart rate
and will notify you with a buzz whenever your heart rate falls below or jumps above the set limits.

# How does it work?
[Try it out](https://www.espruino.com/ide/emulator.html?codeurl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msdeibel/BangleJsWorkoutHearRateMonitor/master/WorkoutHeartRateMonitor.js&upload) using the [online Espruino emulator](https://www.espruino.com/ide/emulator.html).

## Setting the limits
For setting the lower limit press the left part of the watch's touch screen.
Then adjust the value with the buttons 1 (top) and 3 (bottom) of the watch.

For setting the upper limit act accordingly after pressing the right part of the watch's screen.

## Reading Reliability
As per the specs of the watch the HR monitor is not 100% reliable all the time.
That's why the WHRM displays a confidence value for each reading of the current heart rate.

To the left and right of the "Current" value two colored bars indicate the confidence in 
the received value: For 85% and above the bars are green, between 84% and 50% the bars are yellow
and below 50% they turn red.

## Closing the app
Pressing button 2 (middle) will switch off the HRM of the watch and return you to the home screen.

# HRM usage
The HRM is switched on when the app is started. It stays switch on while the app is running, even
when the watch screen goes to stand-by.
